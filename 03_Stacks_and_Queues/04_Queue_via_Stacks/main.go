// Queue via Stacks: Implement a MyQueue class which implements a queue using two stacks.
// SOLUTION
// Since the major difference between a queue and a stack is the order (first-in first-out vs. last-in first-out), we
// know that we need to modify peek() and pop() to go in reverse order. We can use our second stack to
// reverse the order of the elements (by popping sl and pushing the elements on to s2). In such an impleÂ­
// mentation, on each peek() and pop() operation, we would pop everything from sl onto s2, perform
// the peek/pop operation, and then push everything back.
// This will work, but if two pop/peeks are performed back-to-back, we're needlessly moving elements. We
// can implement a "lazy" approach where we let the elements sit in s2 until we absolutely must reverse the
// elements.
// In this approach, stackNewest has the newest elements on top and stackOldest has the oldest
// elements on top. When we dequeue an element, we want to remove the oldest element first, and so we
// dequeue from stackOldest. If stackOldest is empty, then we want to transfer all elements from
// stackNewest into this stack in reverse order. To insert an element, we push onto stackNewest, since it
// has the newest elements on top.
// The code below implements this algorithm.
