// Partition: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come
// before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list the values of x only need
// to be after the elements less than x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the
// "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
// EXAMPLE
// Input:3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition= 5]
// Output:3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8

// SOLUTION
// If this were an array, we would need to be careful about how we shifted elements. Array shifts are very
// expensive.
// However, in a linked list, the situation is much easier. Rather than shifting and swapping elements, we can
// actually create two different linked lists: one for elements less than x, and one for elements greater than or
// equal to x.
// We iterate through the linked list, inserting elements into our before list or our after list. Once we reach
// the end of the linked list and have completed this splitting, we merge the two lists.
// This approach is mostly "stable" in that elements stay in their original order, other than the necessary moveÂ­
// ment around the partition. The code below implements this approach.

	// Partition list
	cur := head
	for cur != nil {
		next := cur.next
		cur.next = nil
		if cur.data < x {
			// Insert node into end of before list
			if beforeStart == nil {
				beforeStart = cur
				beforeEnd = beforeStart
			} else {
				beforeEnd.next = cur
				beforeEnd = cur
			}
		} else {
			// Insert node into end of after list
			if afterStart == nil {
				afterStart = cur
				afterEnd = afterStart
			} else {
				afterEnd.next = cur

// If it bugs you to keep around four different variables for tracking two linked lists, you're not alone. We can
// make this code a bit shorter.
// If we don't care about making the elements of the list "stable" (which there's no obligation to, since the
// interviewer hasn't specified that), then we can instead rearrange the elements by growing the list at the
// head and tail.
// In this approach, we start a"new" list (using the existing nodes). Elements bigger than the pivot element are
// put at the tail and elements smaller are put at the head. Each time we insert an element, we update either
// the head or tail.
