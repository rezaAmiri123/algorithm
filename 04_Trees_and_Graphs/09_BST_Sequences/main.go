package main

// BST Sequences: A binary search tree was created by traversing through an array from left to right
// and inserting each element. Given a binary search tree with distinct elements, print all possible
// arrays that could have led to this tree.
// EXAMPLE
// Input: 1 <- 2 -> 3
// Output: {2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}

// SOLUTION
// It's useful to kick off this question with a good example.
