// ðŸ”‘ Problem: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
// Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

// âœ… Example:
// Input: s = "abcabcbb"
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

// ðŸ§  Hashing + Sliding Window Explanation:
// We use a sliding window and a hash map to track characters and their latest index.
// Steps:
// Start with two pointers: left and right. Both start at 0.
// Use a map charIndex to store the last seen index of each character.
// As you expand the window (right moves), if the character has been seen before
// and its index is â‰¥ left, move left just past that character.
// Update maxLen with the size of the current window (right - left + 1).
// Repeat until the end of the string.

// Time complexity: O(n)
// Space complexity: O(min(n, m)) where m is the size of the charset.

		if right-left+1 > maxLen {

// Want to go one level deeper and modify this to return the actual substring too?
