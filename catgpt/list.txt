Absolutely â€” here's a solid cheat sheet of algorithm types / topics you should know for coding interviews, especially in Go:

ðŸ”¹ Core Algorithm Types

Category	                Subtopics / Common Patterns
String Algorithms	        Substrings, Anagrams, Palindromes, Pattern Matching, Tokenization
Array & Sliding Window	    Max/Min subarray, K-size window, Two Pointers, Prefix Sum
Hashing	                    Frequency Maps, Sets, Deduplication, Grouping
Sorting	                    Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Custom Sort, Bucket Sort
Greedy	                    Interval Scheduling, Jump Game, Change-Making
Dynamic Programming	        Memoization, Tabulation, Subsequence Problems, DP on Strings
Recursion & Backtracking	Combinations, Permutations, N-Queens, Sudoku Solver
Binary Search	            On Sorted Arrays, On Answers, Peak Finding
Graph Algorithms	        BFS, DFS, Topo Sort, Dijkstra, Union Find, Connected Components
Tree Algorithms	            Traversals, Lowest Common Ancestor, BST Operations
Heap / Priority Queue	    Top K Elements, Merge K Lists, Median Finder
Stack / Monotonic Stack	    Next Greater Element, Histogram, Valid Parentheses
Trie (Prefix Tree)	        Word Dictionary, Autocomplete, Prefix Search
Bit Manipulation	        XOR Trick, Bit Masks, Counting Bits, Power of Two
Math & Number Theory	    GCD/LCM, Primes (Sieve), Modular Arithmetic
Interval Problems	        Merge Intervals, Meeting Rooms, Overlaps
Union Find / DSU	        Connected Components, Cycle Detection
Sliding Window + Hashing	Longest Substring, Distinct Elements in Window

ðŸ”¸ Bonus Patterns Worth Practicing
Top K Frequent (heap + map)
Two Sum / 3Sum / 4Sum (hashing + sorting)
Word Ladder (BFS + set)
Knapsack Variants (classic DP)
Median in Stream (two heaps)
